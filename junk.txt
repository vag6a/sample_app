If you've tried to use DRQS since the BNA transition, you may have noticed difficulty opening some tickets owned by other groups.

We will NOT get a blanket access but we can add as many bucket as we want which essentially fulfill what we need.

Please send me a list of any additional groups you think we should have access to today.

Here is the list of all Buckets BBNA is permitted to see, including the newly added buckets.
